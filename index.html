          Apples first originated in central Asia now in Kazakhstan and humans
          started growing them about 4 to 10 thousand years ago into the type of
          apples we have today. Apples later than spread to Europe through trade
          routes like the silk roads and then many farmers started growing
          apples around the world which became one of the most common fruit in
          the world.
        </p>
